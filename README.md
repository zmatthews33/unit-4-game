I made a blend of both HW options.


Rules:
You will be given the Supreme Leader's number at the start of the game. 
There are 2 heroes to each side of him. By clicking on a hero you will add a specific amount of points to your total. 
You WIN by matching your total score to the Supreme Leader's number. If your score goes above, YOU LOSE. The value of each hero will be hidden until you click on it.

More detail:

There are four characters from the comic book Those Shadow People displayed on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game shown under the Supreme Leader's in the middle.

When the player clicks on a character, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score-this amount until the player clicks a character.
When they do click one, the player's score counter updates.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will get a new random number. Also, all the characters will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

The app also shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.


The random number shown at the start of the game should is between 19 - 120.
Each character should has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
